# WeatherApp
This is a simple Java command-line app that fetches current weather data using the OpenWeather API. The user enters a city and U.S. state, and the app returns temperature, weather description, and humidity. You will need to support your own API_KEY and place it in the config.properties file.
Get your API_KEY here: https://home.openweathermap.org
